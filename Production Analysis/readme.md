## 📌 Project Title:
# Production Performance Dashboard using Power BI

## 🎯 Project Objective:
**To develop a dynamic and insightful dashboard that enables real-time monitoring and performance evaluation of production operations in a manufacturing plant. The focus is on visualizing key metrics like work orders, finished goods, defect quantity, and shift-wise analysis to support data-driven decision-making and operational efficiency.**

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used:
- Power BI: Dashboard development & DAX calculations
- DAX: Measures for production targets, rejection %, and completion rates
- Excel: Data source for time-series and categorical analysis
- Data Modeling: Relationship management between production, defects, and shifts


## 📊 Key Metrics:
| Metric                  | Value  |
|-------------------------|--------|
| **Work Orders**         | 295K   |
| **WO Completion Rate**  | 92.56% |
| **Finished Goods (FG)** | 273K   |
| **Defective Quantity**  | 22K    |

## 📈 Dashboard Components & Insights:
1. Production Quantity & Work Order Trend
Line chart showing daily production and work orders from Jan to June 2024.

Indicates volatility and drop in April, with partial recovery later.

2. Production vs Target
Gauge visual showing that 273K units were produced against a 295K target.

~92.56% target achieved — aligns with WO completion %.

3. Shift-Wise Production Analysis

| Shift | Production | Rejection % |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| I     | 182K       | 7.36%       |
| II    | 90K        | 9.42%       |

**Shift I produces more and has a lower rejection rate — suggesting better efficiency.**

## 🔍Outcomes:
- Enabled real-time tracking of production and defects
- Provided actionable insights to reduce shift II rejections
- Supported managers in identifying underperforming days or shifts
- Guided decisions to optimize production targets and part-level focus
